Welcome to the NINT Emulator 1.0 repository, a specialized fork of the renowned Mupen64 and Project64 emulators, enhanced to support the fictional Nintendo Interactive (NINT) peripheral for the Nintendo 64. This project aims to provide a unique emulation experience by integrating features that simulate the NINT's capabilities, such as internet connectivity, weather tracking, and dynamic day/night cycles in games.

## About NINT

The Nintendo Interactive (NINT) was a conceptual expansion for the Nintendo 64, designed to augment games with real-time environmental effects and online features. It was never released commercially, making this emulator the only way to experience what could have been a groundbreaking accessory.

## Features

- **Day/Night Cycle Simulation:** Enhances supported games with real-time day and night transitions based on the system clock.
- **Weather Effects:** Introduces dynamic weather effects in games, affecting gameplay and visuals.
- **Online Connectivity:** Simulates network features allowing for game updates and online play (fictional).
